# Dividend Arbitrage Toolkit

## Overview

This repository contains a Python function for assessing the safety of dividend stocks and a detailed report on dividend arbitrage. The program helps investors identify safe dividend stocks and understand the concept of dividend arbitrage.

## What is Dividend Arbitrage?

Dividend arbitrage is a strategy where investors aim to profit from the difference in stock prices just before and after a company pays out dividends to its shareholders. By purchasing dividend stocks before the ex-dividend date (the last day to qualify for a dividend payment), investors can benefit from a dividend income. Subsequently, they can either hold or sell the stock to capitalize on the stock price adjustment that typically occurs after the ex-dividend date.
